# shopify-clj

A set of libraries for interacting with the [Shopify][shopify] platform:

* `shopify-friend`: provides a [friend][friend] workflow to [authenticate with Shopify shops][auth-docs] using OAuth2.
* `shopify-resources`: functions for interacting with [a shop's resources][resource-docs].
* `shopify-core`: functions used by the other libraries, probably not very useful on its own.

[friend]: https://github.com/cemerick/friend
[auth-docs]: http://api.shopify.com/authentication.html
